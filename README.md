# HUQU---AR---West-Lake-Guided-Tour
AR Sand Table Project of West Lake by Two Individuals

Project Name: AR West Lake Guided Sand Table
Project Overview:
This project aims to provide an immersive and interactive experience of touring West Lake using augmented reality (AR) technology. Drawing inspiration from Su Shi's perspective and his life story, the project follows the narrative of an individual with amnesia, searching for their own identity within the context of West Lake. Participants will uncover the mysteries of their own heritage as they explore the West Lake map.

We have carefully selected five specific locations from the ten renowned scenic spots of West Lake: the Musical Fountain, Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, Leifeng Pagoda, Broken Bridge, and Su Causeway. Each location is accompanied by a corresponding story and interactive elements using AR technology. Additionally, we have developed an AR sand table as a guided tour map to interpret Su Shi's stories related to West Lake.

The "AR Guided Sand Table of West Lake" is designed based on the geographical features of West Lake, incorporating a visual style inspired by gaming aesthetics and traditional Chinese elements. It features an AR geographical sand table that showcases the distinctive information about West Lake. Suspended above the sand table are icon markers representing the selected interactive locations, which allow participants to interact with the sand table as a whole or with individual icons to access information and guided content related to Su Shi's stories. The aim is to provide participants with an enhanced guided tour experience.

Feature 1: West Lake Map Guided Tour
Guided Tour Overview:
Location 1: Musical Fountain
Location 2: Three Pools Mirroring the Moon
Location 3: Leifeng Pagoda
Location 4: Broken Bridge
Location 5: Su Causeway

The AR sand table of West Lake provides a guided tour experience by planning routes for participants based on their coordinates and allowing interaction with the West Lake sand table. Participants can navigate through the West Lake map and interact with the sand table to enhance their tour experience.

# Workflow schedules
Determine and refine the plan in the early stage, make textures for the model in the middle stage, compose the video and create effects in the later stage, overview the preliminary work and the plan, and finalize the plan in the later stage.
In the early stage, the project planned green plants and pets, and designed a variety of interaction and play modes, starting from social issues, determined to make a more complete expression and interpretation, and integrate expression into new gameplay

## Function 2: Interactive display at a fixed location
1. Musical Fountain (interactive display): Goldfish migrate, and goldfish shuttle through the water column with music.
2. Three Pools of the Moon: Portal: Immersive viewing, find clues in the door to solve the mystery.
3. Leifeng Pagoda (Multiplayer Interactive): Help Fahai suppress the White Snake.
4. Broken Bridge: Su Shi broke the bridge and slashed the demon, and the player turned into a swordsman to split the evil in the air with the sword in his hand
5. Su Causeway: Su Shi repairs the embankment, and the player collects the soil in his hand and throws it at the embankment to complete the repair.



Feature 3 Storytelling to bring in
This project takes Su Shi's first perspective to experience and visit the West Lake, takes Su Shi's life story as the main line, and takes an amnesiac person as the perspective to find his own life experience. The ICON of the five point feature information is suspended on the sandbox, and the finger touches it to appear information about the point story, as well as the point information, and the navigation content.

# Long-term goals:
Improve the interactive experience of the sand table, interactive logo, sound effect characteristics, etc.
The guided sand table has functional features and a new experience.
Click on the geolocation icon, the realistic cursor will appear in the sandbox and the navigation cursor will appear on the actual ground, guiding you to the corresponding experience location. Improve the output navigation sandbox, navigation content and navigation accuracy.
The big data collection and content navigation of West Lake information convey more information and stories about West Lake to experiencers.
Deliver a complete story line based on Su Shi.
The reasonable allocation of the story and each point, and the interesting interactive explanation (interactive refinement on the existing outline).
Convey the proper message in an interesting and vivid way.
The output of the corresponding entity can identify the AR interaction around the linkage with the merchant.

2. Objective 2: Interact with the navigation sandbox 
• Task 1: Import AR, consider the actual experience after the build, and adjust the specific location and size of the assets inside the sandbox
• Task 2: Add a cutout for portrait recognition, so that the device can recognize the person, and cut out the portrait on the AR asset without occlusion.





• Task 3: Gesture recognition, touch the icon of the sand table will pop up the geographic information of the corresponding point, story guide, and AR interactive experience.
• Mission 4: Click on the geolocation icon to display the reality cursor in the sandbox and the navigation cursor on the actual ground to guide you to the corresponding experience location.




3. Objective 3: Demonstrate video capture and production
### Task 1: Investigate the flow of people and weather conditions in the corresponding area, and choose a time and place with less people and more light in a short period of time.
### Task 2: Plan the storyboard and video interpretation logic in advance

• Expected accomplishment 3: Partial vision of long-term planning articulated
• Expected Result 4: West Lake is represented through AR projects


# Risks and challenges
1. Stepping into a new field and non-specialization, as an art student who has never been exposed to development and code before, we need to spend more time and energy on areas that we are not good at before for the uncertainty of development projects.
2. Communicate and learn code, and consider things and projects with the way of thinking of programmers when developing.
3. For the control of applicable scenarios and effects, AR projects have limitations on water surface recognition and changes to moving objects, making the project itself full of uncertainty.
4. The challenge of environmental scanning, due to the large number of tourists in the West Lake Scenic Area and most of them are mainly natural landscapes, the scanning is not clear to the plants, and the occlusion of tourists makes the scanning work more difficult.
Update history

v1.5.1 (2024-04-16): Added a gesture interaction version


process display,
1. Blender material construction, the sand table material is divided into two circles, the inner circle is mainly based on the map and the actual investigation of the route is built on the floating green floating island, through the expansion of a single stone UV and shader editing to restore the stylized display of the stone, after the stone is edited according to the real map location of the terrain, and then the map key node coordinates are built. The outer ring focuses on showing the characteristics of West Lake. The intention of the West Lake, such as lotus flowers and lotus leaves, is built with a series of landscapes, showing the characteristics of the West Lake sand table.


2. Import the model into Unity for editing, adjust the effect and texture modification  of the model in Blender, and then write the part of the program




3. Make the UI interface, first draw a plane according to the five map directions and nodes. Next, build in Blender, draw textures for the model, and bind the model.
4. Drop the UI to Unity to add scripts, and add gesture interaction and gesture recognition
5. Arrive at the site for shooting, shoot videos and demonstrate actual cameras according to the drawn storyboard and weather conditions
6. Edit and compose the captured video, as well as dubbing, import a single piece of footage into AE for video tracking, add a mask to the video footage and bind the tracking position, adjust the angle and perspective, and mask the coincident part for K frames
Integrate the relationship between the environment and people and demonstrate ways to interact.
