# HUQU---AR---West-Lake-Guided-Tour
AR Sand Table Project of West Lake by Two Individuals

Project Name: AR West Lake Guided Sand Table
Project Overview:
This project aims to provide an immersive and interactive experience of touring West Lake using augmented reality (AR) technology. Drawing inspiration from Su Shi's perspective and his life story, the project follows the narrative of an individual with amnesia, searching for their own identity within the context of West Lake. Participants will uncover the mysteries of their own heritage as they explore the West Lake map.

We have carefully selected five specific locations from the ten renowned scenic spots of West Lake: the Musical Fountain, Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, Leifeng Pagoda, Broken Bridge, and Su Causeway. Each location is accompanied by a corresponding story and interactive elements using AR technology. Additionally, we have developed an AR sand table as a guided tour map to interpret Su Shi's stories related to West Lake.

The "AR Guided Sand Table of West Lake" is designed based on the geographical features of West Lake, incorporating a visual style inspired by gaming aesthetics and traditional Chinese elements. It features an AR geographical sand table that showcases the distinctive information about West Lake. Suspended above the sand table are icon markers representing the selected interactive locations, which allow participants to interact with the sand table as a whole or with individual icons to access information and guided content related to Su Shi's stories. The aim is to provide participants with an enhanced guided tour experience.

Feature 1: West Lake Map Guided Tour
Guided Tour Overview:
Location 1: Musical Fountain
Location 2: Three Pools Mirroring the Moon
Location 3: Leifeng Pagoda
Location 4: Broken Bridge
Location 5: Su Causeway

The AR sand table of West Lake provides a guided tour experience by planning routes for participants based on their coordinates and allowing interaction with the West Lake sand table. Participants can navigate through the West Lake map and interact with the sand table to enhance their tour experience.

# Workflow schedules
Determine and refine the plan in the early stage, make textures for the model in the middle stage, compose the video and create effects in the later stage, overview the preliminary work and the plan, and finalize the plan in the later stage.
In the early stage, the project planned green plants and pets, and designed a variety of interaction and play modes, starting from social issues, determined to make a more complete expression and interpretation, and integrate expression into new gameplay

## Function 2: Interactive display at a fixed location
1. Musical Fountain (interactive display): Goldfish migrate, and goldfish shuttle through the water column with music.
2. Three Pools of the Moon: Portal: Immersive viewing, find clues in the door to solve the mystery.
3. Leifeng Pagoda (Multiplayer Interactive): Help Fahai suppress the White Snake.
4. Broken Bridge: Su Shi broke the bridge and slashed the demon, and the player turned into a swordsman to split the evil in the air with the sword in his hand
5. Su Causeway: Su Shi repairs the embankment, and the player collects the soil in his hand and throws it at the embankment to complete the repair.



Feature 3 Storytelling to bring in
This project takes Su Shi's first perspective to experience and visit the West Lake, takes Su Shi's life story as the main line, and takes an amnesiac person as the perspective to find his own life experience. The ICON of the five point feature information is suspended on the sandbox, and the finger touches it to appear information about the point story, as well as the point information, and the navigation content.

# Risks and challenges
Identify possible risks and challenges and provide strategies to address them. This can help others understand the potential issues facing the project and demonstrate your competence in project management and risk management.
Communication and feedback
Provide a communication channel for the project's Roadmap and encourage others to provide feedback, suggestions, and opinions. You can provide your contact information or create a dedicated discussion area on GitHub.
1. Stepping into a new field and non-specialization, as an art student who has never been exposed to development and code before, we need to spend more time and energy on areas that we are not good at before for the uncertainty of development projects.
2. Communicate and learn code, and consider things and projects with the way of thinking of programmers when developing.
3. For the control of applicable scenarios and effects, AR projects have limitations on water surface recognition and changes to moving objects, making the project itself full of uncertainty.
4. The challenge of environmental scanning, due to the large number of tourists in the West Lake Scenic Area and most of them are mainly natural landscapes, the scanning is not clear to the plants, and the occlusion of tourists makes the scanning work more difficult.

process display,
1. Blender material construction, the sand table material is divided into two circles, the inner circle is mainly based on the map and the actual investigation of the route is built on the floating green floating island, through the expansion of a single stone UV and shader editing to restore the stylized display of the stone, after the stone is edited according to the real map location of the terrain, and then the map key node coordinates are built. The outer ring focuses on showing the characteristics of West Lake. The intention of the West Lake, such as lotus flowers and lotus leaves, is built with a series of landscapes, showing the characteristics of the West Lake sand table.


2. Import the model into Unity for editing, adjust the effect and texture modification  of the model in Blender, and then write the part of the program

# Risks and Challenges

1. Stepping into a new field and being non professional, as an art student who has never been exposed to development and coding before, we need to spend more time and energy investing in areas we were not good at before when it comes to the uncertainty of development projects.
2. Communication and learning of code, considering things and projects in a programmer's way of thinking during development.
3. For the control of applicable scenarios and effects, the AR project has limitations in identifying water surfaces and changing moving objects, making the project itself full of uncertainty.
4. The challenge of environmental scanning is that due to the large number of tourists in the West Lake scenic area, which are mainly natural landscapes, the scanning of plants is not clear, and the occlusion of tourists makes the scanning work more difficult.
