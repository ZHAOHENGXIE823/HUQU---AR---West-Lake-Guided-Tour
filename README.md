# HUQU---AR---West-Lake-Guided-Tour
VR Sand Table Project of West Lake by Two Individuals

Project Name: AR West Lake Guided Sand Table
Project Overview:
This project aims to provide an immersive and interactive experience of touring West Lake using augmented reality (AR) technology. Drawing inspiration from Su Shi's perspective and his life story, the project follows the narrative of an individual with amnesia, searching for their own identity within the context of West Lake. Participants will uncover the mysteries of their own heritage as they explore the West Lake map.

We have carefully selected five specific locations from the ten renowned scenic spots of West Lake: the Musical Fountain, Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, Leifeng Pagoda, Broken Bridge, and Su Causeway. Each location is accompanied by a corresponding story and interactive elements using AR technology. Additionally, we have developed an AR sand table as a guided tour map to interpret Su Shi's stories related to West Lake.

The "AR Guided Sand Table of West Lake" is designed based on the geographical features of West Lake, incorporating a visual style inspired by gaming aesthetics and traditional Chinese elements. It features an AR geographical sand table that showcases the distinctive information about West Lake. Suspended above the sand table are icon markers representing the selected interactive locations, which allow participants to interact with the sand table as a whole or with individual icons to access information and guided content related to Su Shi's stories. The aim is to provide participants with an enhanced guided tour experience.
